<h1>Here Comes the Song â€” Australiaâ€™s Songwriting Camp</h1>

<p>*Here Comes the Song* is about bringing together a core group of high-performing, versatile producers and songwriters with one clear purpose â€” to collaborate on great pop and contemporary music.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t a personal branding exercise. Itâ€™s not about social media content or what weâ€™ve all done individually. Itâ€™s about the work â€” building trust, writing with intent, and leaving egos at the door.</p>

<p>We want to help shape a better songwriting culture in Australia â€” one built on openness, generosity, and creative excellence. Weâ€™re looking outward, learning from the best camps globally â€” Sweden, LA, Nashville â€” and asking how we can create something here that lasts.</p>

<p>2025 is our first year. It will be small, focused, and built around doing the work well. Writing great songs. Building good habits. And creating an environment people want to come back to year after year.</p>

<h2>August 9â€“11, 2025</h2>
<p><strong>Private location within 2 hours of Byron Bay</strong><br>
Invitation-only. Limited to 20 participants.</p>
