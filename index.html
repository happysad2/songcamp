<h1>Here Comes the Song â€” Australiaâ€™s Songwriting Camp</h1>

<p>Launching in 2025, *Here Comes the Song* is a curated songwriting retreat designed to bring together a select group of writers, producers, and artists to collaborate with intent.</p>

<p>Our goal is simple: to grow a more open and world-class songwriting culture in Australia â€” one that fosters collaboration, creative excellence, and global relevance. Inspired by the success of leading songwriting camps in Sweden, the US, and the UK, this is our first step toward building something lasting and uniquely Australian.</p>

<p>This yearâ€™s camp will be intentionally small, focusing on high-impact collaboration and the foundations of what will become a national platform. Across the weekend, weâ€™ll write, record, and refine â€” while also sharing frameworks, creative practices, and international insights that elevate everyone involved.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re setting the tone for whatâ€™s to come: a songwriting culture thatâ€™s ambitious, supportive, exportable, and deeply connected.</p>

<h2>August 9â€“11, 2025</h2>
<p><strong>Private location within 2 hours of Byron Bay</strong><br>
Invitation-only. Limited to 20 participants.</p>

Songwriting as a culture. Collaboration as a practice.<br><br>
Here Comes the Song is for writers who believe in building something bigger than the individual â€” a creative ecosystem, one great song at a time.
